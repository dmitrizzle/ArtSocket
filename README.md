# ArtSocket STATIC
This is a static render of ArtSocket website downloaded with `wget` from the original PHP servers that rendered the content of `master` branch here.

If you'd like to learn how the website core was built and functions please check out `master` branch.

## Purpose
This branch is the actively maintained version of ArtSocket. It's much simpler/lighter (no Stripe, MailChimp or any kinds of forms) version, designed for cheap hosting and simple maintenance.

## History
ArtSocket is a project that has been in active development since 2012. In 2017 the development has stopped in favor of [Analog.Cafe](http://analog.cafe) - a new project for the creative community, specifically film photographers and writers.

While the technology and content (as of today) is somewhat outdated, this project has been encouraged to remain in maintenance by Eureka King and the community of authors, artists and photographers who have contributed their work.

To minimize the amount of work and $$$ required to keep the lights on, the project has been rendered as a static website. Currently, the articles and posts from this website send good Google goodness in form of links, goodwill and reference to the contributors. This website's analytics are also being used for the DEMO account on [Archi.AI](https://www.archie.ai) (a Eureka King project).
